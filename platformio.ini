; we had very similar issue like --> https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh/issues/159
; but according to the discussion.. this should not happen again.. since that should be fixed @ 1.2.7 and i was using 1.2.8. no?
; so.. somehow commented other version requirements.. (dependent libs.)
; now.. it seems.. works fine..?
; but no clear mind. what was it? and why now ok?
